This Project is the Third Codepath Project in Web102 Yippie!!

In it the project contains useState for variables and components, passes JSON so cards info can be changed which is contained in questions.jsx.

Uses onClick for both the flipping of the card and switching the questions both backwards and forward. 


The Quiz and JSON code looks like this:

Currently, the Website looks like this:
![Page](https://github.com/abledaniel/Web102Project3/blob/master/src/assets/plant.png)

It uses the passed Title and tag-line to display it and the amount of cards.
The Cards are also are able to be solved by typing an answer and submitting it.
If the answer is correct, the card flips and the next card is displayed.
The Cards are also able to be shuffled.
